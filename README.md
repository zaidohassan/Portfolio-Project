### Dashboard

After logging in, you will be redirected to the Dashboard where you can begin scanning your first book! Enter the ISBN-13, which then will give you the info of the book on the left card. You can hover over the title book image which will give you the image of the book to
compare with the book on hand. Binding is shown because sometimes you Paperback/Hardcover are presented with the same ISBN.

You can enter an input price of how much you would like to sell the book for given the current BuyBox Price if you would like to stay
competitive. Also you have the current Sales Rank on hand to determine if you would like to even proceed with the Input Price.

Input Price and Cost of Good will be entered and then you will have your fee calculator to show you your Profit via FBA or MF. (Two different
methods of selling on Amazon which depends on your business model)

You have the option of accepting the book (which is the add button) or reject the book (the x button).

Adding it will add it to your inventory and reject will dent it, after your selection it will clear your fields which allows you to keep scanning!

You must accept/reject a book so we can keep your stat of the day which is shown on the top right corner. Each symbol can be hovered over to
tell you what stat is it describing.
